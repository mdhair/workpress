# Workpress
### A Vagrant "Work Box" for Wordpress
A work box, as defined by a Google search, means "a portable box used for storing or holding tools". And that is what I intend Workpress to be; a portable Vagrant box used for storing all my favorite Wordpress development tools.

Workpress is a simple Vagrant box running Ubuntu 14.04 and targeted for Wordpress development. Workpress is intended for Wordpress developers (like me) that would love to have a simple Vagrant box that installs Wordpress and all their favorite development tools. It is for people that find other great projects such as [VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV), [VCCW](https://github.com/vccw-team/vccw), and [Scotch Box](https://github.com/scotch-io/scotch-box) a little too bulky for their work.

### Installation

1. Install VirtualBox - https://www.virtualbox.org/
1. Install Vagrant - http://www.vagrantup.com/
    * Verify Vagrant is installed by running `vagrant -v` in your terminal.
1. Download Workpress (choose one of the following ways):
    * Download and extract the GitHub repository - https://github.com/jalenconner/workpress/archive/master.zip
    * Clone the GitHub repository - `git clone https://github.com/jalenconner/workpress.git`
1. Navigate to the folder you just downloaded and run `vagrant up` in your terminal. Please be patient; it always take a little time to download and boot up the VM the first time.
1. Visit http://192.168.33.10 in your browser and you should see your Wordpress site.
1. That's it! Were you expecting more?

### Usage
##### Basic Vagrant Commands
Start or resume your server - `vagrant up`

Pause your server - `vagrant suspend`

Turn off your server - `vagrant halt`

SSH into your server - `vagrant ssh`

##### Provisioning
I am currently using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) to provision the box. You can find all the provisioning files in the provisioning folder. Vagrant uses the Vagrantfile to run a shell script on the VM that installs Ansible and starts the Ansible playbook. That way you don't have to install Ansible on your host machine.

##### Changing the IP
Workpress is setup to use the IP address of 192.168.33.10. If this IP is conflicting with something on your network, you may change it in the Vagrantfile to the IP address of your choosing and then run `vagrant reload` in your terminal.

##### Development URL
So who would want to visit http://192.168.33.10 when instead they could just browse to http://workpress.dev?
1. `$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater`
1. `$ sudo visudo`
1. Add the following to the end of the file:
```
# Allow passwordless startup of Vagrant with vagrant-hostsupdater.
Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_HOSTS_ADD = /bin/sh -c echo "*" >> /etc/hosts
Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_HOSTS_REMOVE = /usr/bin/sed -i -e /*/ d /etc/hosts
%admin ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: VAGRANT_HOSTS_ADD, VAGRANT_HOSTS_REMOVE
```
1. Visit http://workpress.dev
1. You can configure this url in the Vagrantfile.
1. That's it! Were you expecting more?

A big thanks to the wonderful [Vagrant::Hostsupdater](https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater) plugin.
